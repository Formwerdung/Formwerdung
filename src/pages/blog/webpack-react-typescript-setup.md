# A minimal Webpack setup for React with Typescript, Prettier and ESLint

**Lead**

Create-react-app, Gatsby and friends come with add a lot of custom

To show some general things with React, I needed an environment where I have a lot of control without a lot of extra code, keeping it simple and transparent. I also wanted to rely on default behaviour wherever possible to really see the differences the additional libraries make in the compiled code.

I was looking for something more transparent that keeps a lot of default behaviour intact. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible (except for my linting!) so

## 1. Make a little app

Make sure to have Typescript set up in you IDE

## 2. Use Babel and Webpack to compile

## 3. Add a type-checking command

## 4. Configure linting
